# Drive (MVP) - File and Folder Management

A single-user file management application with hierarchical folder structure, mimicking basic cloud storage navigation capabilities.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Drive MVP is a functional file management system that allows users to organize files in a nested folder hierarchy with full CRUD operations. The application provides an intuitive interface for managing files and folders, complete with breadcrumb navigation and contextual actions.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development

### Backend

- **Next.js API Routes** - Serverless API endpoints
- **PostgreSQL** - Relational database for metadata storage
- **Prisma** - Modern ORM for database operations
- **File System** - Local disk storage for uploaded files

## ✨ Key Features

### User Experience

- Alphabetically sorted file/folder lists
- Visual distinction between files and folders
- File size and last modified date display
- Upload progress acknowledgment
- Unique name validation within folders

### Analytics & Telemetry

- Client-side event logging for all user interactions
- Session-based tracking
- Non-blocking async logging
- Support for CLICK, KEY_PRESS, SCROLL, GO_TO_URL, SET_STORAGE, and CUSTOM events

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18.x or higher
- **PostgreSQL** 14.x or higher
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd drive-mvp
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/drive_mvp?schema=public"

# File Storage
UPLOAD_DIR="./uploads"

# Application
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

### 4. Set up the database

```bash
# Generate Prisma Client
npx prisma generate

# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# (Optional) Seed the database
npx prisma db seed
```

### 5. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### Folder Operations

#### Get Folder Contents

```
GET /api/folders/{id}
```

Returns all files and folders within the specified folder.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "clx...",
      "name": "Documents",
      "type": "folder",
      "size": null,
      "updatedAt": "2025-11-16T10:30:00Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "cly...",
      "name": "report.pdf",
      "type": "file",
      "size": 524288,
      "updatedAt": "2025-11-16T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Create Folder

```
POST /api/folders
```

**Body:**

```json
{
  "name": "New Folder",
  "parentId": "clx..."
}
```

### File Operations

#### Upload File

```
POST /api/files/{parent_id}
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

**Form Data:**

- `file`: File to upload

#### Download File

```
GET /api/files/{id}
```

Streams the file content as a downloadable response.

### Item Operations

#### Update Item (Rename)

```
PUT /api/items/{id}
```

**Body:**

```json
{
  "name": "New Name"
}
```

#### Delete Item

```
DELETE /api/items/{id}
```

Recursively deletes the item and all its children (if folder).

### Analytics

#### Log Event

```
POST /_synthetic/log_event
```

**Body:**

```json
{
  "session_id": "session_abc123",
  "action_type": "CLICK",
  "payload": {
    "text": "Upload File",
    "page_url": "/",
    "element_identifier": "upload-button",
    "coordinates": { "x": 100, "y": 200 }
  }
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Tests

```bash
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

### Test Coverage

```bash
npm run test:coverage
# or
yarn test:coverage
```

**Target Coverage:** Minimum 80% line coverage for core API logic

### Mandatory Test Cases

- ✅ Hierarchy: Creating nested folder structure and retrieving subfolder contents
- ✅ CRUD: Upload, download, and deletion of files
- ✅ Recursion: Deleting folder removes all children
- ✅ Edge Cases: Duplicate name validation within same parent

## 📊 Event Logging

All user interactions are logged via the `logEvent` utility:

```typescript
import { logEvent } from "@/lib/logger";

// Example: Log a click event
logEvent("CLICK", {
  text: "Create Folder",
  page_url: window.location.href,
  element_identifier: "create-folder-btn",
  coordinates: { x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY },
});
```

### Supported Event Types

- `CLICK` - User clicks
- `KEY_PRESS` - Keyboard input
- `SCROLL` - Page scrolling
- `GO_TO_URL` - Navigation
- `SET_STORAGE` - localStorage/sessionStorage operations
- `CUSTOM` - Application-specific events

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- File uploads are validated for size and type
- Unique name constraints prevent overwriting
- Cascade deletion ensures data integrity
- Path traversal protection on file operations
- Input sanitization on all user-provided data
